###What’s OOP?
Imagine everything as objects — a car 🚗, a book 📚, or even a cute little puppy 🐶. OOP helps us model complex systems by treating real-world entities as objects within the program. We assign them classes (their blueprint), attributes (their characteristics), and methods (their actions)!

###Key Concepts:

Class: The blueprint or prototype, like a recipe 🍲! Defines the structure for creating objects.
Object: A specific instance of a class. Think of it as a cake made from that recipe 🎂.
Attributes: Characteristics or properties of an object, like the color of a car.
Methods: Actions or behaviors that the object can perform (e.g., drive() for a car).
